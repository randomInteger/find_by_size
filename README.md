# find_by_size.py
Python3 code that recursively walks a starting path's sub-paths and prints every file that is within the size window.

# usage
example.  Find all files under ~/src and all of the sub-paths of ~/src between 1 and 100 GB, or 1 and 1000 KB, or 50 and 256 MB.

$./walk.py ~/src 1 100000 MB

# future improvements
better error reporting would be more friendly.
